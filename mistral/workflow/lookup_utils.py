"""
The intention of the module is providing various DB related lookup functions
 for more convenient usage within the workflow engine.

Some of the functions may provide caching capabilities.

WARNING: Oftentimes, persistent objects returned by the methods in this
module won't be attached to the current DB SQLAlchemy session because
they are returned from the cache and therefore they need to be used
carefully without trying to do any lazy loading etc.
These objects are also not suitable for re-attaching them to a session
in order to update their persistent DB state.
Mostly, they are useful for doing any kind of fast lookups with in order
to make some decision based on their state.
