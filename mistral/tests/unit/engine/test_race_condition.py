  description: |
    The idea is to use action that runs faster than engine.start_workflow().
    And we need to check that engine handles this situation as well. This was
    a situation previously that led to a race condition in engine, method
    on_action_complete() was called while DB transaction in start_workflow()
    was still active (not committed yet).
    To emulate a short action we use a workflow with two start tasks so they
    run both in parallel on the first engine iteration when we call method
    start_workflow(). First task has a short action that just returns a
    predefined result and the second task blocks until the test explicitly
    unblocks it. So the first action will always end before start_workflow()
    method ends.

  output:
    result: <% $.result %>

  tasks:
    task1:
      action: std.echo output=1
      publish:
        result: <% task(task1).result %>
