    Cleanup transports along RPC clients. Fixed a bad weird condition in the
    API server related to cron-triggers and SIGHUP. The parent API server
    creates a RPC connection when creating workflows from cron triggers. If a
    SIGUP signal happens after, the child inherits the connection, but it's
    non-functional.
