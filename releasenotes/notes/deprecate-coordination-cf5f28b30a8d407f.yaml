deprecations:
  - |
    The coordination service inside mistral has been used only to list the
    mistral services list behind the endpoint ``v2/services``.
    This feature is not enabled by default and needs a specific ``coordinator``
    ``backend_url`` configuration to be set for mistral to answer the services
    list correctly.
    Coordination rely on the ``tooz`` project and, depending on the driver in
    use, may need eventlet monkeypatching.
    Because we want to get rid of all eventlet code inside mistral, the
    ``v2/services`` endpoint is now deprecated and all coordination code
    will be dropped in the next cycle.
