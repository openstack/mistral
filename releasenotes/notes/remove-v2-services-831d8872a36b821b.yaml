    The `/v2/services` endpoint in mistral is now removed.
    This endpoint was using tooz.coordination which we decided to get rid of
    in the previous release.
    That endpoint was introduced in the past to help administrator know which
    services were running but we believe this is not widely used and can
    easily be replaced by external tooling.
