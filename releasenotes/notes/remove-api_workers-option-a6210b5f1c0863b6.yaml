deprecations:
  - |
    Deprecate the ``api_workers`` option for mistral-api. This option was used
    to spawn multiple workers when using oslo.service wsgi server.
    Since we moved to cheroot, this is not possible anymore.
    If you want to use more than one process to handle Mistral API requests,
    you should consider using mistral-wsgi-api behind a wsgi server.
