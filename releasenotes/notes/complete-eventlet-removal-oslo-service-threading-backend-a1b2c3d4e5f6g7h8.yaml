    **Complete Eventlet Removal and Oslo.Service Threading Backend Migration**
    
    Mistral has completed its migration away from eventlet and now uses the
    oslo.service threading backend exclusively. This represents the final step
    in the eventlet removal process.

    **Key Changes:**

    * **Service Framework Migration**: Mistral now uses oslo.service's threading
      backend instead of eventlet for service management. The threading backend
      is initialized early in the application startup process.
    * **Monkey Patching Removed**: All ``eventlet.monkey_patch()`` calls have been
      removed from both the main service entry point (``cmd/launch.py``) and the
      test suite initialization. This eliminates eventlet's modification of the
      Python standard library.
    * **RPC Executor Migration**: The deprecated ``oslo_rpc_executor`` configuration
      option has been removed. All RPC servers (engine, executor, event-engine)
      now use the threading executor exclusively.
    * **Dependency Updates**: The ``eventlet`` dependency has been removed from
      requirements.txt and replaced with the necessary oslo.service threading
      backend dependencies.

    **Configuration Impact:**

    * If you were explicitly setting ``oslo_rpc_executor = threading`` in your
      configuration, you can safely remove this setting as threading is now the
      only supported executor type.
    * No other configuration changes are required. Mistral services will
      automatically use the threading backend.

    This migration builds upon the extensive component-level eventlet removal work
    completed in previous releases and represents the final step in Mistral's
    modernization to a pure threading-based architecture.
