    Workflow output sometimes was not calculated correctly due to
    the race condition between different transactions: the one that
    checks workflow completion (i.e. calls "check_and_complete") and
    the one that processes action execution completion (i.e. calls
    "on_action_complete"). Calculating output sometimes was based on
    stale data cached by the SQLAlchemy session. To fix this, we just
    need to expire all objects in the session so that they are
    refreshed automatically if we read their state in order to make
    required calculations. The corresponding change was made.
