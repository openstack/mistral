    Removed DB polling from the logic that checks readiness of a "join" task
    which leads to situations when CPU was mostly occupied by scheduler that
    runs corresponding periodic jobs and that doesn't let the workflow move
    forward with a proper speed. That happens in case if a workflow has lots
    of "join" tasks with many dependencies. It's fixed now.
