=====================
Debugging and Testing
=====================

To debug using a local engine and executor without dependencies such as
RabbitMQ, make sure your ``/etc/mistral/mistral.conf`` has the following
settings::

  [DEFAULT]
  rpc_backend = fake

  [pecan]
  auth_enable = False

and run the following command in *pdb*, *PyDev* or *PyCharm*::

  mistral/cmd/launch.py --server all --config-file /etc/mistral/mistral.conf --use-debugger

.. note::

    In PyCharm, you also need to enable the Gevent compatibility flag in
    Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Python Debugger -> Gevent
    compatible. Without this setting, PyCharm will not show variable values
    and become unstable during debugging.

Running unit tests in PyCharm
=============================

In order to be able to conveniently run unit tests, you need to:

1. Set unit tests as the default runner:

  Settings -> Tools -> Python Integrated Tools ->
  Default test runner: Unittests

2. Enable test detection for all classes:

  Run/Debug Configurations -> Defaults -> Python tests -> Unittests -> uncheck
  Inspect only subclasses of unittest.TestCase

Running examples
================

To run the examples find them in mistral-extra repository
(https://github.com/openstack/mistral-extra) and follow the instructions on
each example.


Automated Tests
===============

On Mistral project we have two separate test suites:

* Unit tests - executed by Jenkins CI job in OpenStack gerrit (python-style
  checks and execution of all unit tests)
* Integration tests - executed by Devstack Gate job in OpenStack Gerrit
  (integration tests for Mistral after the OpenStack deployment with devstack)

Where we can find automated tests
=================================

mistral:

* Unit tests can be found at
  https://github.com/openstack/mistral/tree/master/mistral/tests/unit
* Integration tests can be found at
  https://github.com/openstack/mistral-tempest-plugin/tree/master/mistral_tempest_tests/tests

python-mistralclient:

* Unit tests can be found at
  https://github.com/openstack/python-mistralclient/tree/master/mistralclient/tests/unit
* Integration tests can be found at
  https://github.com/openstack/python-mistralclient/tree/master/mistralclient/tests/functional

How to execute tests manually
=============================

Almost all existing automated tests can be executed manually on the
developer's desktop (except those which check OpenStack actions).
To do this, you should clone "mistral" repository (or "python-mistralclient")
and run the corresponding commands.

Cloning a repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://git.opendev.org/openstack/mistral.git
    $ cd mistral

Unit tests
----------

To run all unit tests:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tox

To run unit tests against a specific python version:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tox -e py3

To run tests from a specific test class (using a specific python version):

.. code-block:: bash

    tox -e py3 -- 'DataFlowEngineTest'

Integration tests
-----------------

There are several suites of integration tests the mentioned repositories:

mistral-tempest-plugin:

* mistral_tempest_tests/tests/api/v2/test_workflows.py - contains the tests
  checking Mistral API v2 related to workflows
* mistral_tempest_tests/tests/api/v2/test_actions.py - contains the tests
  checking Mistral API v2 related to actions
* and so on

python-mistralclient:

* mistralclient/tests/functional/cli/v2/ - contains test suites which check
  interaction with Mistral using CLI

To run integration tests:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install git+http://git.opendev.org/openstack/tempest.git
    $ pip install git+http://git.opendev.org/openstack/mistral-tempest-plugin.git
    $ tempest run -- mistral_tempest_plugin.mistral_tempest_tests.api.v2

Mistral-Dashboard debug instructions
====================================

**Pycharm**

Debugging OpenStack Mistral-Dashboard is the same as debugging OpenStack
Horizon.

The following instructions should get you sorted to debug both on the same run.

Set PyCharm debug settings:

1. Under File > Settings > Languages and Framework > Django -
Enter the following:

  a. Check "Enable Django Support"
  b. Django project root: your file system path to Horizon project root
  c. Settings: openstack_dashboard/settings.py (under your Horizon folder)
  d. Manage script: manage.py (also in your horizon folder)
  e. Click OK

.. image:: img/dashboard_django_settings.png

2. Enter debug configurations menu, using the tiny arrow pointing down,
   left to the "play" icon, or under the run menu

.. image:: img/Pycharm_run_config_menu.png

3. In the new window, click the green plus icon and then select "Django server"
   to create a new Django Server configuration.

4. In the new window appeared:

  a. Name that configuration Horizon
  b. Enter some port so it won't run on the default (for example - port: 4000)

.. image:: img/dashboard_debug_config.png

5. Click on Environment variables button, then in the new window:

  a. Make sure you have PYTHONUNBUFFERED set as 1
  b. Create a new pair - DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE : openstack_dashboard.settings
  c. When finished click OK.

.. image:: img/dashboard_environment_variables.png


You should now be able to debug and run the project using PyCharm.
PyCharm will listen to any changes you make
and restart the Horizon server automatically.

**Note**: When executing the project via PyCharm Run / Debug,
you could get an error page
after trying to login: "Page not found (404)".
To resolve that - remove the port from the browser URL bar,
then login.
You should be able to login without it.
After a successful login bring the port back - it will continue your session.

**Further notes**

- If you need help with PyCharm and general debugging, please refer to:
  `JetBrains PyCharm developer guide
  <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/help/debugging.html>`_

- If you would like to manually restart the apache server,
  open a terminal and run::

    $ sudo service apache2 restart

  *(if not under Ubuntu, replace "sudo" with an identical command)*
